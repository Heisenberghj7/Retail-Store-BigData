## Part I: Data Migration & Data Analysis

**Importing a Table from MySQL to HDFS:**

1. Create the database and the tables in MySQL.
2. Use Sqoop to import the tables in the retail store database and save it in HDFS under "/user".
3. Import the tables to a Parquet data format rather than the default file form (text file).

**Data Analysis:**
HiveQL is Hive’s query language, a dialect of SQL for big data. By using HiveQL, write a query to:

- Get How many Orders were placed
- Get Average Revenue Per Order
- Get Average Revenue Per Day Per Product
